### **How to Fix a Refrigerator That’s Not Making Ice**  

#### **1. Check the Water Fill Tubes**  
- **Step 1:** Unplug the refrigerator and turn off the water supply.  
- **Step 2:** Inspect the ice maker mold—if there are no ice cubes or they’re very small, the fill system may be blocked.  
- **Step 3:** Examine the fill tube and fill cup behind the ice maker for ice buildup or obstructions.  
- **Step 4:** Check the outlet tubing from the water inlet valve to the ice maker for kinks or blockages.  
- **Step 5:** If tubes are frozen or damaged, replace them.  

#### **2. Inspect the Water Inlet Valve**  
- **Step 1:** Locate the water inlet valve (usually at the back of the fridge).  
- **Step 2:** Check for a filter screen—if clogged, clean it to restore water flow.  
- **Step 3:** If the valve is leaking or not shutting off properly, replace it.  

#### **3. Replace the Ice & Water Filter**  
- **Step 1:** Locate the filter (inside the fridge or at the base).  
- **Step 2:** Remove the old filter and install a new one.  
- **Step 3:** Flush the system by running water through the dispenser for a few minutes.  

#### **4. Test or Replace the Ice Maker Assembly**  
- **Step 1:** Manually trigger the ice maker (if possible) to see if it cycles.  
- **Step 2:** If it doesn’t work, check for power and proper water flow.  
- **Step 3:** If defective, replace the ice maker assembly.
