### **How to Fix a Refrigerator That Runs Too Long**  

#### **1. Check the Defrost Timer**  
- **Unplug the fridge** before starting.  
- Locate the defrost timer (behind the kickplate, control panel, or back wall).  
- Remove the timer and set a multimeter to **Rx1**.  
- Touch one probe to the **common terminal (labeled "3" or "C")** and the other to each remaining terminal.  
- If any pair shows **no continuity**, replace the timer.  

#### **2. Test the Defrost Heater**  
- Unplug the fridge.  
- Locate the heater (usually behind the freezer’s back panel).  
- Disconnect the heater wires and test for **continuity** with a multimeter.  
- If there’s **no continuity**, replace the heater.  

#### **3. Inspect the Defrost Termination Thermostat**  
- Unplug the fridge.  
- Locate the thermostat (near the evaporator coils).  
- Test for continuity with a multimeter.  
- If **no continuity**, replace the thermostat.  

#### **4. Check Door Gaskets**  
- Inspect the **fresh food and freezer door seals** for cracks or gaps.  
- Close the door on a dollar bill—if it slides out easily, the gasket is weak.  
- Replace damaged gaskets to maintain proper cooling efficiency.  

#### **5. Test the Condenser Fan Motor**  
- Unplug the fridge.  
- Locate the fan (near the compressor at the back).  
- Spin the fan blade—if it doesn’t move freely, the motor may be faulty.  
- Test for continuity with a multimeter. If **no continuity**, replace the motor.  

#### **6. Check the Evaporator Fan Motor**  
- Unplug the fridge.  
- Locate the fan (inside the freezer compartment).  
- Test for continuity with a multimeter.  
- If **no continuity**, replace the motor.  

#### **7. Inspect the Sealed System (Advanced Repair)**  
- If all other parts check out, the issue may be a **refrigerant leak or compressor failure**.  
- This requires a **professional technician** for diagnosis and repair.  

**Note:** Always **unplug the refrigerator** before testing or replacing parts. If unsure, consult a technician.
