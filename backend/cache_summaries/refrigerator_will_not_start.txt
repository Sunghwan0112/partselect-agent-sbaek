### **How to Fix a Refrigerator That Won’t Start**  

#### **1. Check the Power Supply**  
- Ensure the refrigerator is plugged in and the outlet is working.  
- Test the outlet with another device.  
- Check the circuit breaker or fuse box for tripped breakers or blown fuses.  

#### **2. Inspect the Overload Relay & Start Capacitor**  
- **Unplug the fridge** and remove the rear access panel.  
- Locate the **overload relay** (usually attached to the compressor).  
- Remove the relay and inspect for **burn marks, cracks, or damage**.  
- If equipped, check the **start capacitor** for bulging or leaks.  
- **Test with a multimeter** (set to Rx1) by placing probes on the terminals. A faulty relay or capacitor will show no continuity or incorrect readings.  
- **Replace if defective.**  

#### **3. Test the Cold/Temperature Control**  
- Locate the **temperature control knob** (inside the fridge).  
- Turn the dial to the coldest setting—listen for a **click** (indicates it’s working).  
- If no click, unplug the fridge and **test the control’s continuity** with a multimeter.  
- **Replace the control if faulty.**  

#### **4. Check the Electronic Control Board (If Applicable)**  
- Some fridges have a **main control board** that manages power distribution.  
- Look for **burn marks, loose wires, or damaged components**.  
- If suspected faulty, **reset the board** by unplugging the fridge for 5 minutes.  
- If issues persist, **replace the control board.**  

#### **5. Verify the Compressor**  
- If the relay and capacitor are good but the compressor **doesn’t start or hums**, the compressor may be faulty.  
- **Professional repair may be needed** for compressor replacement.  

#### **Final Steps**  
- Reassemble all parts securely.  
- Plug the fridge back in and monitor for proper startup.  

If the problem persists, consider consulting a professional technician.
