### **How to Fix a Dishwasher That Won’t Dry Properly**  

#### **1. Check the Heating Element**  
- **Turn off power** to the dishwasher (unplug or shut off the circuit breaker).  
- **Locate the heating element** (inside the dishwasher, at the bottom of the tub). It may be covered—remove the cover if needed.  
- **Remove the lower access panel** to disconnect the wires from the heating element terminals.  
- **Test for continuity** with a multimeter set to **Rx1**:  
  - Touch each probe to a terminal.  
  - A reading between **0 and infinity** (check your manual for exact specs) means it’s working.  
  - If the reading is **exactly 0 or infinity**, the heating element is faulty and needs replacement.  

#### **2. Inspect the High Limit Thermostat**  
- The thermostat regulates the heating element’s temperature.  
- **Disconnect power** and locate the thermostat (usually near the heating element).  
- **Test for continuity** with a multimeter:  
  - If there’s no continuity, replace the thermostat.  

#### **3. Check the Rinse Aid Dispenser**  
- Rinse aid helps dishes dry faster by reducing water spots.  
- **Ensure the dispenser is filled** and functioning properly.  
- **Clean the dispenser** if clogged.  

#### **4. Run a Hot Water Cycle Before Starting**  
- Ensure hot water is reaching the dishwasher by running the kitchen faucet until it’s hot before starting a cycle.  

#### **5. Use the High-Temperature or Heated Dry Option**  
- Select the **heated dry** or **sanitize** cycle if available.  

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, further diagnosis or professional help may be needed.
