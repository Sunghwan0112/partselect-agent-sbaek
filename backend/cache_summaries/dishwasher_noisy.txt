### **How to Fix a Noisy Dishwasher**  

#### **1. Check the Pump**  
- **Unplug the dishwasher** for safety.  
- **Locate the pump** (usually behind the lower access panel).  
- **Test the pump with a multimeter**:  
  - Set the multimeter to **Rx1 (resistance mode)**.  
  - Place probes on the pump’s terminals—**a reading near zero means it’s working**.  
  - Check for a ground issue by touching one probe to a terminal and the other to the pump’s metal housing—**no reading should appear**.  
- **If the pump fails the test**, replace it.  

#### **2. Inspect the Wash Arm Bearing Ring & Spray Arm Seal**  
- **Remove the lower spray arm** (twist or unclip it).  
- **Check the bearing ring and seal** for cracks, wear, or debris.  
- **Clean or replace** damaged parts if needed.  

#### **3. Examine the Spray Arms**  
- **Remove the spray arms** (top and bottom).  
- **Check for clogs** in the spray holes—clean them with a toothpick or soft brush.  
- **Ensure they spin freely**—if loose or damaged, replace them.  

#### **4. Reassemble & Test**  
- **Reinstall all parts securely**.  
- **Run a test cycle** to check if the noise is gone.  

If the noise persists, further diagnosis may be needed. Let us know if you need more help!
