### **How to Fix a Refrigerator Freezer That’s Too Cold**  

#### **1. Check the Air Damper or Freezer Control**  
- **Unplug the refrigerator** for safety.  
- Locate the **air damper or freezer control** (usually behind a vent in the fresh food compartment).  
- Remove the vent and inspect the **damper flap** for damage or resistance when moving it.  
- If the flap is stuck, damaged, or hard to move, **replace the air damper or freezer control**.  

#### **2. Inspect the Temperature Sensor or Thermistor (Electronic Models Only)**  
- If your fridge has an **electronic control**, a faulty **thermistor or temperature sensor** could cause incorrect cooling.  
- Locate the sensor (often near the evaporator coils or inside the freezer).  
- Test for continuity with a multimeter—if defective, **replace the sensor**.  

#### **Next Steps**  
- If neither part fixes the issue, check the **evaporator fan motor or defrost system**.  
- Still too cold? **Consult a technician** for further diagnosis.
