### **How to Fix a Dishwasher Door Latch**  

#### **Step 1: Inspect the Door Catch**  
- Locate the **door catch** (attached to the top of the dishwasher tub).  
- Check if itâ€™s properly adjustedâ€”misalignment can prevent the latch from engaging.  

#### **Step 2: Test the Door Latch Assembly**  
1. **Unplug the dishwasher** for safety.  
2. Remove the **inner door panel** to access the latch assembly.  
3. Check if the door catch mechanically activates the switches.  

#### **Step 3: Test for Continuity (If Needed)**  
- Use a **multimeter** set to **Rx1**.  
- Touch the probes to the switch terminalsâ€”a reading near **zero** means itâ€™s working.  
- If the reading is anything else, the **latch assembly needs replacement**.  

#### **Step 4: Replace the Door Latch (If Broken)**  
- Order a **replacement door latch assembly** if testing confirms failure.  
- Install the new latch, ensuring proper alignment with the door catch.
