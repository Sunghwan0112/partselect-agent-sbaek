### **How to Fix a Dishwasher That Won’t Fill With Water**  

Follow these steps to diagnose and repair the issue:  

#### **1. Check the Water Inlet Valve**  
- **Unplug the dishwasher** and turn off the water supply.  
- Locate the **water inlet valve** (usually on the lower left side behind an access panel).  
- Inspect for **damage, cracks, or wear**.  
- If faulty, replace the **water inlet valve**.  

#### **2. Test the Float Assembly**  
- The **float** prevents overfilling by rising with water levels.  
- Manually lift the float—if the dishwasher still won’t fill, the float may be stuck or damaged.  
- Clean any debris and ensure it moves freely. If broken, replace the **float assembly**.  

#### **3. Inspect the Float Switch**  
- The **float switch** signals the control board to stop filling when water reaches the correct level.  
- Test with a multimeter for continuity. If defective, replace the **float switch**.  

#### **4. Verify the Door Switch**  
- If the door isn’t securely latched, the dishwasher won’t start filling.  
- Check for proper alignment and test the switch with a multimeter. Replace if faulty.  

#### **5. Ensure Proper Water Supply**  
- Confirm the **water supply valve** is fully open.  
- Check for **kinks in the inlet hose** or low water pressure.  

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, further diagnosis may be needed for the control board or timer.
