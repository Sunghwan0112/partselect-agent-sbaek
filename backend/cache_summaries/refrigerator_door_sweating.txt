### **How to Fix a Refrigerator Door That’s Sweating**  

#### **1. Check and Replace the Door Gasket (Seal)**  
- **Inspect the gasket** for cracks, tears, or looseness.  
- **Test the seal** by placing a dollar bill between the door and fridge, then close it. If the bill slides out easily, the seal is bad.  
- **Replace the gasket** if damaged. Order a new one matching your fridge model.  

#### **2. Fix the Ice/Water Dispenser Door (If Applicable)**  
- If moisture is near the dispenser, check the **dispenser door or flapper seal**.  
- Replace the **dispenser door assembly** or **ice door kit** if the seal is worn or not closing tightly.  

#### **3. Adjust or Replace Door Hinges**  
- If the door doesn’t close properly, check for **misaligned or broken hinges**.  
- Tighten loose screws or **replace hinges** if they’re bent or damaged.  

#### **4. Ensure Proper Door Closure**  
- Check if the **door closure cam** (if your fridge has one) is working correctly.  
- Replace the **door closure cam kit** if the door doesn’t stay shut.  

#### **5. Reduce Humidity Around the Fridge**  
- Make sure the room isn’t too humid (common in hot weather).  
- Ensure proper ventilation around the fridge to prevent condensation.  

If the sweating continues after these steps, check for **defrost system issues** or call a technician.  

**Need parts?** Search for your fridge model to find the right replacement gasket, dispenser door, or hinges.
