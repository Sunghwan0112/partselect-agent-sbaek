### **How to Fix a Dishwasher That Won’t Drain**  

#### **1. Check the Piston & Nut Assembly**  
- **Step 1:** Unplug the dishwasher.  
- **Step 2:** Locate the piston & nut assembly (usually under the sump cover at the bottom of the tub).  
- **Step 3:** Inspect the assembly—it should move up and down freely. If stuck or not sealing properly, replace it.  

#### **2. Inspect the Drain Pump & Motor**  
- **Step 1:** Disconnect power and water supply.  
- **Step 2:** Locate the drain pump (typically at the bottom of the dishwasher).  
- **Step 3:** Check for clogs, damage, or a burnt-out motor. If faulty, replace the drain pump.  

#### **3. Examine the Check Valve Flapper**  
- **Step 1:** Power off the dishwasher.  
- **Step 2:** Find the check valve (usually near the drain pump).  
- **Step 3:** Ensure the flapper moves freely and isn’t stuck open or closed. Replace if damaged.  

#### **4. Check the Drain Hose**  
- **Step 1:** Turn off power and water.  
- **Step 2:** Detach the drain hose from the dishwasher and sink/garbage disposal.  
- **Step 3:** Clear any clogs with a pipe cleaner or replace the hose if cracked.  

#### **5. Test the Timer (Older Models)**  
- **Step 1:** Unplug the dishwasher.  
- **Step 2:** Locate the timer (often behind the control panel).  
- **Step 3:** If the timer is faulty and not advancing the cycle, replace it.  

#### **6. Inspect the Belt (If Applicable)**  
- **Step 1:** Power off the unit.  
- **Step 2:** Check the belt connecting the motor to the pump for wear or breakage.  
- **Step 3:** Replace if damaged.  

#### **Final Steps**  
- Reassemble all parts securely.  
- Restore power and run a test cycle to confirm proper drainage.
