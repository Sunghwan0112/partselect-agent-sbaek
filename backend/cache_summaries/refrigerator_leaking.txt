### **How to Fix a Leaking Refrigerator**  

#### **1. Check the Door Gaskets/Seals**  
- **Unplug the refrigerator** for safety.  
- Inspect the rubber seals around the fridge and freezer doors for:  
  - Cracks, tears, or warping  
  - Mold or discoloration  
  - Weak spots that prevent a tight seal  
- If damaged, **replace the gaskets** to ensure a proper seal.  

#### **2. Inspect the Water Inlet Valve** (For fridges with ice/water dispensers)  
- **Turn off the water supply** to the fridge.  
- Locate the **water inlet valve** (usually at the back or bottom).  
- Use a **multimeter** to test for continuity:  
  - Disconnect the valve’s wires.  
  - Set the multimeter to **ohms (Ω)**.  
  - Place probes on the valve’s terminals—**a reading of 200–500Ω means it’s working**. No reading? **Replace the valve**.  
- Check for **cracks or leaks** in the valve or hoses.  

#### **3. Examine the Ice Maker Assembly**  
- If leaking is near the ice maker:  
  - Check for **cracked or misaligned water lines**.  
  - Ensure the **ice maker fill tube isn’t frozen or clogged**.  
  - If the ice maker is overflowing, the **water inlet valve may be faulty** (see Step 2).  

#### **Next Steps**  
- If the issue persists, check the **defrost drain** (clogged drains can cause leaks inside the fridge).  
- For persistent leaks, consider **professional repair** or further diagnostics.
