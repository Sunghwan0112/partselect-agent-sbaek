### **How to Fix a Refrigerator Light Thatâ€™s Not Working**  

#### **1. Check the Light Bulb**  
- **Visually inspect** the bulb for a broken filament.  
- **Test with a multimeter** (if available):  
  - Remove the bulb.  
  - Set the multimeter to **Rx1 (ohms)**.  
  - Place one probe on the **bottom** of the bulb and the other on the **threading**.  
  - If the reading shows **infinity (no continuity)**, replace the bulb.  
- **Quick fix**: Simply replace the bulb with a new one.  

#### **2. Inspect the Light Socket**  
- **Unplug the fridge** before checking (safety first!).  
- Look for **discolored or damaged terminals** in the socket.  
- If the socket appears **burnt or loose**, replace it.  

#### **3. Test the Door Light Switch**  
- The switch turns the light on/off when the door opens/closes.  
- **Press the switch manually** (with the door open) to see if the light turns on.  
- If the light **doesnâ€™t respond**, the switch may be faulty and need replacement.  

#### **Next Steps**  
- If none of these steps fix the issue, further electrical troubleshooting may be needed.  
- **Need parts?** Search for your fridge model to find the correct replacement bulb, socket, or switch.
